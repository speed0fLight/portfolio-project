            <h1 class="text text-center">Break it up</h1>
            <p>When you face a problem that you cannot understand, you have to dive down into it's roots. If a car
                engine has a problem, you must isolate that part, if that part has different pieces, then you isolate
                those different pieces. Work your way down until you find out what you want to change, and learn from
                it.</p>
            <p>Not everything is always laid out in front of you. You can you can only understand as much as you've
                done. The kicker of all problems stem from experience with them. With the right experience that you are
                guaranteed to excel in what you do.</p>

            <h1 class="text text-center">Map it out</h1>
            <p>Everyone has their own process for problem solving. Some like to draw visual maps out for themselves,
                others like to draw simple step by step instructions. In this type of subject, every problem is tackled
                from every angle, because only one is certainly not enough.</p>
            <p>Understanding how a machine works is as fundamental as understanding how each of it's parts plays a role
                in it. For software, it's no different. All there is to do is find your approach and continue on from
                there.</p>

        <h1 class="text text-center">Reverse Engineering the LCD1602 Component</h1>
        <p>This project involves both advanced hardware and programming skills. I reverse engineered a ASCII
            (Character only) Display and caused it to output individual pixels, allowing graphical programs to run
            on it. I forked the library on github, and made my own which allowed low level control of pixel and LCD
            control. I learned about working with source code and creating libraries for the Arduino.</p>
